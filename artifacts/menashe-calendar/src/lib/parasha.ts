He then declares: 'Come, buy wine and milk without money and without cost.' The abundance promised for obedience in Re'eh finds its ultimate prophetic fulfillment in Isaiah's vision of restoration." } },
  "Shoftim": { hebrew: "שֹׁפְטִים", book: "Devarim", verses: "16:18–21:9", summary: "Laws for judges, kings, Levites, and prophets are given. Cities of refuge are described. Rules of warfare, including exemptions and prohibited practices. The unsolved murder ritual.", number: 48, haftarah: { book: "Isaiah", verses: "51:12–52:12", summary: "Isaiah proclaims that God Himself is Israel's judge, redeemer, and comforter. 'Awake, awake, O Zion!' The consolation message challenges Israel's fear of oppressors — just as Shoftim legislates how Israel is to maintain justice and courage in facing enemies." } },
  "Ki Teitzei": { hebrew: "כִּי-תֵצֵא", book: "Devarim", verses: "21:10–25:19", summary: "The largest single concentration of mitzvot: laws covering family, property, sexual ethics, the treatment of others, business practices, and many more. 'Do not forget what Amalek did.'", number: 49, haftarah: { book: "Isaiah", verses: "54:1–10", summary: "God speaks to Israel as a husband to a wife who was briefly abandoned but will be gathered with great mercy. 'For the mountains may depart but My kindness shall not depart.' This unconditional love answers Ki Teitzei's extensive laws regulating human relationships." } },
  "Ki Tavo": { hebrew: "כִּי-תָבוֹא", book: "Devarim", verses: "26:1–29:8", summary: "Laws of first fruits and tithes. The covenant renewal ceremony at Mounts Gerizim and Ebal. The lengthy tochecha—blessings for obedience and terrible curses for disobedience.", number: 50, haftarah: { book: "Isaiah", verses: "60:1–22", summary: "'Arise, shine, for your light has come!' Isaiah's vision of Jerusalem's radiant future reverses the darkness of Ki Tavo's curses. Nations will stream to Israel's light; her gates will be open always. The ultimate blessing answers the covenant's ultimate warning." } },
  "Nitzavim": { hebrew: "נִצָּבִים", book: "Devarim", verses: "29:9–30:20", summary: "Moses gathers all Israel for a covenant renewal. He assures them that repentance is always possible. The commandment is not in heaven but in our mouths and hearts. Choose life.", number: 51, haftarah: { book: "Isaiah", verses: "61:10–63:9", summary: "Isaiah sings of God clothing Israel in garments of salvation — a joyous song answering Nitzavim's covenantal 'choose life.' God will remember His love for Israel and all Israel's afflictions. 'In all their troubles He was troubled, and the angel of His presence saved them.'" } },
  "Vayeilech": { hebrew: "וַיֵּלֶךְ", book: "Devarim", verses: "31:1–31:30", summary: "Moses announces he is 120 years old and will not cross the Jordan. He transfers leadership to Joshua. He writes the Torah and commands it be read every seven years at Sukkot.", number: 52, haftarah: { book: "Isaiah", verses: "55:6–56:8", summary: "'Seek God while He may be found; call upon Him while He is near.' Isaiah's call to return mirrors Moses's final exhortation in Vayeilech. God promises that even foreigners and strangers who hold fast to His covenant will be brought to His holy mountain." } },
  "Ha'azinu": { hebrew: "הַאֲזִינוּ", book: "Devarim", verses: "32:1–32:52", summary: "Moses recites a poetic song reviewing Israel's history and God's relationship with the people—their rebellion, punishment, and eventual redemption. God tells Moses to ascend Mount Nebo to see Canaan.", number: 53, haftarah: { book: "2 Samuel", verses: "22:1–51", summary: "David's great song of thanksgiving — a poetic masterpiece parallel to Moses's Song of Ha'azinu in every way. Both are songs of a leader at the end of a life of faithful service, praising God who is their Rock, their shield, and their salvation." } },
  "Vezot Haberakhah": { hebrew: "וְזֹאת הַבְּרָכָה", book: "Devarim", verses: "33:1–34:12", summary: "Moses blesses each of the twelve tribes individually. Then Moses ascends Mount Nebo and dies, looking over the Promised Land. The Torah closes with praise for Moses, the greatest prophet.", number: 54, haftarah: { book: "Joshua", verses: "1:1–18", summary: "Immediately after Moses's death, God commissions Joshua: 'Be strong and courageous.' Joshua rallies the tribes and they affirm their loyalty. The haftarah begins where the Torah ends — Moses passing the mantle to Joshua as the Jewish people stand on the threshold of their inheritance." } },
